# AI-ML Projects Collection 

This repository is a curated collection of seven machine learning projects
completed during my early learning phase.

Each sub-project reflects a different stage of my growth in ML and
computational biology from basic pipelines to deep learning, from
interpretability to clinical-style datasets.

The goal of this repo is to: show practical ML skills across diverse datasets

This repo now serves as a unified hub for showcasing my foundations in
machine learning.

## 📂 Sub-Projects Overview

### **1. Cancer Dataset Pipeline (Python, GEO, FastAPI)**
A complete end-to-end ML workflow created before I even understood what a
"pipeline" was. Includes GEO data extraction, preprocessing, Random Forest
training, ROC curves, and a FastAPI deployment.

**Folder:** `Cancer_Dataset_Pipeline/` 

---

### **2. Interpretability in R (Logistic Regression)**
A small R project using metabolic biomarkers to classify breast cancer cases.
Focuses on model coefficients, p-values, and interpretability principles.

**Folder:** `BreastCancer_R_Interpretability/` 

---

### **3. CNN for Brain Tumor Classification**
My first deep learning experiment: building and improving a CNN for MRI tumor
classification. Includes augmentation, dropout, and confusion matrix analyses.

**Folder:** `Brain_Tumor_Classifier_CNN/`  

---

### **4. Clinical Data Preprocessing (Breast Cancer Relapse)**
A small project exploring preprocessing of clinical-style data, experimenting
with encoding, missing values, label definitions, and a Random Forest model.

**Folder:** `BreastCancer_Relapse_Using_ClinicalData/`  
---

### **5. PCA for Gene Expression (Workflow Demonstration)**
A foundational transcriptomics ML workflow including numeric conversion,
normalization, PCA dimensionality reduction, Random Forest demonstration, and
a pipeline-style structure.

**Folder:** `Gene_Expression_Model/`

---

### **6. Heart Disease Prediction + XAI (SHAP)**
A classical ML model trained on the UCI Cleveland dataset with SHAP
explainability added to understand feature contributions.

**Folder:** `Heart_Disease_Prediction_XAI/`  

---

### **7. Gene Expression Preprocessing & Visualization (QC Practice)**
Basic transcriptomics preprocessing steps — filtering, log2 normalization,
heatmap + boxplot generation — to practice foundational QC workflows.

**Folder:** `gene_expression_analysis/`

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This collection is not about perfect models.

It is about:
- learning through experimentation  
- building foundational intuition  
- discovering ML workflows step by step  
- documenting growth over time  
- transforming messy practice scripts into clean, reusable projects  

This repo represents the early chapters of my ML journey.

---

## 🔧 Future Roadmap

- Add unit tests and modular pipelines  
- Convert notebooks to standardized scripts  
- Add comparison studies (classical ML vs DL)  
- Implement SHAP + LIME across multiple models  
- Introduce MLOps structure to selected projects

If you're exploring ML, bioinformatics, or early portfolio building,
I hope this collection gives you a realistic view of what learning looks like —
one small project at a time.
