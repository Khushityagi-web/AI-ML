# AI-ML Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of seven machine learning projects completed during my early learning phase.

Each sub-project reflects a different stage of my growth in machine learning and computational biology — from basic pipelines to deep learning, from interpretability to clinical-style datasets.

This repository now serves as a unified hub for showcasing my foundations in machine learning.

## Sub-Projects Overview

### 1. Cancer Dataset Pipeline (Python, GEO, FastAPI)

A complete end-to-end ML workflow created before I fully understood the concept of a “pipeline.”  
Includes GEO data extraction, preprocessing, Random Forest training, ROC curves, and a FastAPI deployment.

**Folder:** `Cancer_Dataset_Pipeline/`

---

### 2. Interpretability in R (Logistic Regression)

A small R project using metabolic biomarkers to classify breast cancer cases.  
Focuses on model coefficients, p-values, and interpretability principles.

**Folder:** `BreastCancer_R_Interpretability/`

---

### 3. CNN for Brain Tumor Classification

My first deep learning experiment: building and improving a CNN for MRI tumor classification.  
Includes data augmentation, dropout, and confusion matrix analysis.

**Folder:** `Brain_Tumor_Classifier_CNN/`

---

### 4. Clinical Data Preprocessing (Breast Cancer Relapse)

A project exploring preprocessing of clinical-style data, including encoding, handling missing values, defining labels, and training a Random Forest model.

**Folder:** `BreastCancer_Relapse_Using_ClinicalData/`

---

### 5. PCA for Gene Expression (Workflow Demonstration)

A foundational transcriptomics ML workflow including numeric conversion, normalization, PCA dimensionality reduction, Random Forest demonstration, and a pipeline-style structure.

**Folder:** `Gene_Expression_Model/`

---

### 6. Heart Disease Prediction + XAI (SHAP)

A classical ML model trained on the UCI Cleveland dataset with SHAP-based explainability to understand feature contributions.

**Folder:** `Heart_Disease_Prediction_XAI/`

---

### 7. Gene Expression Preprocessing & Visualization (QC Practice)

Basic transcriptomics preprocessing steps — filtering, log2 normalization, heatmap generation, and boxplot visualization — to practice foundational QC workflows.

**Folder:** `gene_expression_analysis/`

## Skills Demonstrated Across This Collection

- Classical machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM fundamentals)  
- Deep learning (CNNs)  
- Explainable AI (SHAP)  
- Transcriptomics preprocessing and PCA  
- Clinical dataset preprocessing  
- GEO data extraction (NCBI Entrez API)

## Purpose of This Repository

This collection is not about perfect models.

It is about:

- Learning through experimentation  
- Building foundational intuition  
- Discovering ML workflows step by step  
- Documenting growth over time  
- Transforming messy practice scripts into clean, reusable projects  

This repository represents the early chapters of my machine learning journey.

## Future Roadmap

- Add unit tests and modular pipelines  
- Convert notebooks to standardized scripts  
- Add comparison studies (classical ML vs deep learning)  
- Implement SHAP and LIME across multiple models  
- Introduce MLOps structure to selected projects  

If you are exploring machine learning, bioinformatics, or early portfolio building, I hope this collection provides a realistic view of what learning looks like — one small project at a time.
